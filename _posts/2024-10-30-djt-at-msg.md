On October 27th, 2024, I went to my first political rally. In fact, I may have found myself at the 2nd most newsworthy Trump rally of all time. On October 27th, 2024, Donald Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden.

When I found out that I would be working in New York City for the fall 2024 co-op term, I thought about the idea of attending a Trump rally. More than just showing my support, I thought it would be almost a historic experience. Trump rallies were one of the most famous parts of the 2016 election season. Although they have not had the same reputation for controversy in the subsequent elections, they remained popular and energetic. Win or loss, this will be Trump's last election, and thus the last chance to attend one of his rallies. I considered the possibility of going out to Pennsylvania some weekend if the circumstances worked, but I ultimately decided against it as it became more troublesome the more I thought about it.

Although I was a bit bummed that I seemed to have just missed the chance at achieving this mini-dream of mine, I tend to be quite the homebody anyways, so I was used to being away from the action.

However, life can sometimes pleasantly surprise you. About two weeks before the rally, I heard about an upcoming Trump rally in New York City on a political podcast I regularly listen to. After some thought, I decided to register for a ticket. In any case, I didn't have to go if I ended up deciding against it. It was a good thing I did, since apparently the tickets "sold out" quite quickly. Although they didn't actually check our tickets in the end, I probably would not have gone if I did not have a ticket.

Even after signing up, I was hesitant to go. I had heard that you had to wait hours and hours before the start of the event to have any chance to get into a Trump rally. I flipped between thinking I should definitely not miss this opportunity of a lifetime and thinking if it was worth it to potentially wait in line for half the day only to end up watching the rally from outside the arena. In the end, I decided to go, with the back-up plan of bailing in case I thought I had no chance of getting into the event proper.

After Mass ended on Sunday morning, I headed straight for Manhattan from Brooklyn. I made a quick stop along the way at McDonald's to eat breakfast, which I had not had the opportunity to do before Mass. This led to a tiny detour, as I thought it would be wise avoid the McDonald's beside Madison Square Garden (which was the right decision).

I knew I was at the right place the moment I got off the Subway at Penn Station. You could see the people wearing MAGA hats and other Trump paraphernelia. I followed the red hats and arrived at the line waiting to get into the venue. The email the Trump team sent said that the doors would open at noon, while the event started at 2:30, but when I arrived a little past 11, the entire street was packed for about 2-3 blocks leading up to the arena.

You could feel the energy. It was not as chaotic as the 2021 Trucker Rally, the only other political event I have participated in, but there was a fair share of protestors and other people doing their thing.

The initial wait was quite boring. I listened to a group of people in front of me talk about politics, ranging from Trump's latest appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience to the war in Ukraine. Although I thought about joining in, my introversion ultimately prevented me from doing so. In any case, with no offense to my fellow Trump supporters, the conversation was not too interesting to me. It consistented mostly of generic Republican talking points. There were also various shenanigans going on around us, from a (very good) Kim Jong-Un impersonator passing by, doing a nice royal wave (which I was not quick enough to catch on video) to a group of Jewish boys in a circle, jumping around and singing (what I assume are) Hebrew songs, as well as periodic USA chants. And on a side note, I was surprised in general at how many Jews there were. In addition to the group of Jewish boys, I found myself sitting or standing next to Jews on 2 other occasions over the course of the day. You've never seen so many MAGA yarmulkes!

As the hours passed, we slowly made our way from one line to the next. 2PM, the time that the doors were supposed to close, came and went when I was standing across from the street to Madison Square Garden, which led me to wonder whether I would end up getting in. But I heard someone near me reminding his friends to "have faith." By 2:30, we were right in front of the entrance, and our admission to the venue was all but guaranteed. The exicitement was building, with a massive sign welcoming us to the event and advertisements for the Kalshi betting website showing Trump's odds surging.

I must now confess a wrongdoing. At the final point of the line, we discovered that there was in fact another parallel line coming from the next street. The two lines were separated by some barriers. For some reason, our side was filled with people, while the other side was virtually empty, with people running through the entrance. I watched as someone decided to breach the barrier. My first reaction was to go with them. At heart, I have the instinct to act selfish when there are stakes. I might have had some hesitations as I moved from one side to the other, but the speed of it all and some pushing from those around me brought me to the other side without much issue. I ended up waiting in the other line, slightly ahead of where I was in the first line. Before long, we were moving again. At first I couldn't see what was ahead of me, but then I realized people were again breaching the barrier into a third area, which led straight into security. Literally as I approached the opening in the barrier, with the excuse that I was simply filing out with many others, a woman beside me complained to the security guards. I froze, look from the woman to the security guard. The security guards promptly closed the barrier and apologized to the woman. I felt guilty enough to stay where I was. Luckily, it was only a few minutes until we were allowed in the "legal" way.

There was airport-like security, beneath a giant screen with a picture of Trump and the message "Dream Big." I was behind a man and his daughter and in front of two German girls. In the other line I caught a glimpse of an old man wearing a "Reagan Bush '84" shirt. My favorite part was when security told us to "just put everything in your hat," of course referring to the MAGA hats that most of us had. After passing through security, I felt like I was officially in. I took the bracelet that was given to me and headed towards the 8th floor as directed.

When I got to the 8th floor, I first walked around the outside area. It was like any other arena. I passed by the concession stands, opting not to buy any food. After walking around the floor for an arbitrary distance, I chose an entrance to go into the arena. The event had started. Tony Hinchcliffe was speaking. I had no idea who he was and didn't really pay attention. He would later go on to be, somehow, the most controversial part of the night. Sadly, I missed his most controversial joke. Although the lower seats closer to the stage were filled, the upper area was still relatively empty. I sat down between a pair of Jewish guys and a family whose language and ethnicity I could not pin down (probably somewhere between the Iron Curtain and India).

The initial speakers were not very interesting. I knew almost none of them. The first "famous" person to speak was Rudy Giuliani. I forgot whether he got a standing ovation, but for sure his welcome was warmer than those before him. His speech was mediocre, and his fame only a taste for what was to come. After Giuliani, the speakers continued to be quite boring.

I found the little campaign videos between speakers much more interesting than the speakers themselves at this point. The one that stuck with me the most featured one of Trump's most famous, and in my opinion most touching, lines: "They're not after me. They're after you; I'm only in the way." I always loved that line, both in terms of what it meant to me, and its rhetorical effectiveness. No matter how flawed Trump is, there's something instinctual that responds to this kind of us-versus-them mentality, or more positively, someone reaching out his hand to be your friend. There is nothing that touches you more than a friend when you feel like the world is against you - that the future is grim.

Anticipating that more interesting speaker could begin appearing at any moment, I left the arena to go buy some water. I was shocked - but on second thought not shocked - that bottled water was $5.50, while a 1/4 pound hotdog (the same as the Costco hotdog) sold for $9.50. I was not going the night without water, so I coughed up the money, took the bottle (and they didn't even let you keep the cap, I assume due to littering), and made my way back into the arena. Despite thinking I had the entrance number I left memorized, I found myself in a foreign place upon my re-entry. I wandered around before giving up and finding a new seat. This time I was beside a pair of Asian young men, one was East Asian and the other Indian. A bit later, a young guy, who I believe was black (but could've been Arab) sat on my other side.

After a long lead up, we finally made it to the juicy part. The first "famous" speaker was Vivek Ramaswamy. He got a rupturous applause and standing ovation. It warmed my heart to know that someone as radical and libertarian in his sympathies as Ramaswamy was so beloved among these Trump Republicans. These big weights really separated themselves. While speakers like Mike Johnson and Elise Stefanik rattled off tired talking points without much charisma, Vivek immediately cracked the audience up with his clever jokes.

After Vivek was Tulsi Gabbard, who also received a standing ovation. While her speech was more demure, it marked the first "expression of love," as someone shouted "I love you Tulsi!" to which Tulsi responded with a cool "I love you, too." This was only the first "I love you" of the night.

After Tulsi was Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. I think he might've received the biggest applause of any speaker, saving Donald and Melania Trump. The black guy sitting next to me point and said "God bless that man." I found this very interesting. I also found it encouraging, as RFK Jr. is good on so many issues, many of which Republicans are generally not as good on, such as chronic disease and healthy food.

After RFK Jr. was Tucker Carlson. Despite some political differences, I have an unhealthy amount of respect for Carlson. I suppose first impressions made all the difference for me, as I remember watching a Tucker Carlson speech and feeling, after only a few minutes, how charismatic the man is. I truly believe he may be a more charismatic speaker than Trump. I don't think he will ever run for office, but I think he has a much better shot of winning than basically any other person on the Republican bench. Carlson is interesting because he is not a populist. He is an elitist in the Hoppean sense. He thinks and doesn't follow the Fox News line (clearly). I think his speech was a bit too cerebral from a political rally. Some parts didn't land as much as I think he'd hoped. 

Tucker was followed by Hulk Hogan - a bit of comic relief after Tucker's more intellectual speech. Although out of order, I'll also mention here that Dana White was a speaker later on, who also received ruckus applause. As a nerd through-and-through, I know nothing about the UFC, but all the evidence seems to point to it being one of the most popular sports in America (and that is saying something given how important sportsball is here).

After Hogan was Dr. Phil, the "founder of Merit Street Media." When they introduced him, I was disappointed that apparently a new slew of irrelevant people were being paraded out, until I heard the name "Phil McGraw." I had no idea Dr. Phil was a Republican - he had had Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh on his show before, but always seemed to be more sympathetic to the liberals they were debating. It seemed the rest of the world was surprised, too - I don't think he had really been political in the past before. He is Christian, so I suspect he has always been some kind of center-right. His speech, unfortunately, was long as boring. He spoke about cancel culture and people bullying Trump supporters, and how Trump is not a bully (because there is no power imbalance between him and Kamala). He had a weird dig at Trump, I think, saying that "unlike him [presumably Trump?], I know that [as a celebrity] I know nothing about policy." Throughout the speech he never seemed to fully endorse Trump. It was honestly a confused speech, and near the end a man sitting close to me said "get off the stage," which was the only time that night someone expressed frustration at a speaker.

After this long, winding speech, Dr. Phil finally introduced JD Vance to the stage. I was a bit disappointed, as I assumed that Vance would go immediately before Trump, as the Vice Presidential candidate, which meant that there would be no Elon. Vance gave a funny speech, like Vivek (it's easier to laugh when you're in a crowd). It's weird that they were classmates at Yale and ended up in such similar positions. At the mention of Tim Walz, the crowd began chanting "Tampon Tim." "You guys can say that, I don't think I should," was Vance's response after cracking up and letting the chant go on for a few moments.

After Vance was the Trump kids, mixed with a few random other people. I never liked the Trump kids too much (although at least it seems they stopped inviting Ivanka). They got huge applauses, but I think their performances were very lackluster. People seem to like Don Jr. a lot, but I never saw it. And also I realized when I was listening to him that his girlfriend might be older than Melania, something I confirmed is true afterwards, which is super weird.

Don Jr. was followed by a businessman who lost most of his employees during the 9/11 attacks. While his story was sad, he was not that interesting, and rattled off (weirdly) a few Bush-era talking points about Jihad. However, after his speech, we were surprised when he introduced "the greatest capitalist in American history" (something Saifedean Ammous would dispute), Elon Musk. As a video of his landing rocket played on the Jumbotrons, the crowd stood up and roared. Elon's welcome was tier 1 - at the level of RFK. Elon is a bit awkward and speaks with a funny accent, but it seems he really thinks about the issues and is a true believer. They really got to him when they trans'd his son. They announced the Department of Government Efficiency (DoGE) with Elon claimng they could cut "at least 2 trillion" from the 6.5 trillion budget deficit this year. As with all Trump's promises, I'll believe it when I see it, but a promise is always better than nothing at all.

Elon Musk introduced Melania Trump, who may have received the 2nd largest applause. A second-language speaker and someone who is not really political in any way, I didn't expect much from her speech (and in fact have already forgotten what it was about). The important part is that after her was the man himself: Donald John Trump.

Of course, he received the loudest applause. The most famous man in the world. He gave his regular routine, very similar content as his Rogan appearance (which he mentioned by name when I think he realized he was repeating his points), and snuck in a reference to the chart, that he loves, which saved his life in Butler, Pennsylvania. Although the original email said Trump would speak at 5PM, he ended up taking the stage close to 9PM, ending close at close to 10PM.

Trump was not a perfect President. There are a million reasons he was not, especially from a libertarian perspective. He could even reasonably be called a bad President. But nothing is perfect. History only happens once. There are no controlled experiments. It is impossible to determine whether Trump was better than Hillary would've been, especially if we consider second- and third-order effects. I support Trump because of what he represents. He represents what is good about America and the Western world at large. Going to this rally had an emotional effect on me that only bolsters my support of him, so I can only imagine how it is for the normal person that doesn't pay attention to policy wonkery. People who resonate with Trump's offer of friendship and of protection. Trump is a loud, brashm arrogant, opinionated, overweight billionaire. He never reads, but became one of the most successful people of all time in all of his pursuits. He is a symbol for everything good and bad about America. Most of all, he has a deep, instinctual love of the country and its people, something that most politicians lack. He makes people feel heard. He, whether intentionally or not, changed history in a way that, once everything is considered, was very positive for the future.

This is how I will try to analyze all historical figures going into the future. It is easy for libertarians to condemn great men of the past. Libertarian purity tests know no bounds, as "the NAP is sin, but better." But as a fair-minded (armchair) historian, we must consider the alternatives and higher-order effects. We must understand the historical context, that all men are flawed, and that it is often the most flawed of men that do the greatest things. While it is impossible to understand the full historical and cultural context of far away lands and long ago times, my support of Donald Trump has made me realize that history and its Great Men are infinitely more complex than we can reasonably understand.
