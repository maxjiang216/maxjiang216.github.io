I’ve now seen some people claim that having a hard money or a money with fixed or decreasing supply would prevent loaning money with positive interest. The intuitive idea is that if all lenders were able to pay back their loans with positive interest, there would have to be an increase in the money supply. This is not true, and simple analysis can debunk this claim.

Now, it is true that if the world switched to hard money, be it gold or Bitcoin, real interest rates would likely fall. Of course, if you think the value of a unit of currency will fall over time, you would demand a higher interest rate, to keep your purchasing power plus be compensated for refraining from spending for the period of the loan.

However, it is far from impossible. First of all, on the gold standard, loans were not uncommon. Gold and silver were the primary monies in the Roman World, yet the Bible talks a lot about usury and usurers. Clearly this was not an esoteric concept in past societies.

One may argue that while gold is generally considered hard money, its supply is still growing (historically the growth rate is about 1-2% a year), so in fact there is money constantly being created. Additionally, people would have defaulted on their loans historically, which would in some sense “destroy” the money lent out, so it is not hard to imagine the accounting under the gold standard working out even if in theory it were not possible.

However, it is easy to create a scenario with a fixed supply of money, where all borrowers pay back their loan with positive interest, and no borrowers default.

Consider a community with 1002 people, two of whom are Alice and Bob. Alice has no money, Bob has $10000, and the remaining 1000 people each have $100. Alice is a good cook and she wants to start a business - but she does not have the capital to do so. She borrows $10000 from Bob to build the restaurant and buy the ingredients she needs. Her cooking is very popular and she earns $20 from each of the 1000 other people in the community - for a total of $20000. She pays Bob back $11000 - a 10% interest. She is left with $9000. So not only was she able to pay back the loan with interest, she was also able to profit from the situation! Now, Alice has $9000, Bob has $11000, and each of the remaining 1000 people has $80. If you think about the transfer of money, the ultimate result was that the consumers, the 1000 people, paid Alice and Bob, who were both needed for the business to exist, for the service they received at the restaurant. It is not hard to imagine this situation extending to many lenders and borrowers. A capitalist society would likely work like this - with consumers paying, directly or indirectly, to savers.

There you go. There are no contradictions. In fact, there is reason to believe that there will always be people who would profit from borrowing money. If you have a business idea that can profit in monetary terms (which would presumably be an even larger real return under appreciating hard money), you would gladly borrow money at any positive interest rate under your profit rate. There will always be profitable businesses in monetary terms, even with deflationary money, since otherwise everyone would just hold their money. But this contradicts that there is price deflation, since this implies positive productivity, meaning someone has to be doing something with their money. Instead, lending would exist in a capitalist society with hard money as a way to divert resources to their most profitable, and thus most valued, uses.
