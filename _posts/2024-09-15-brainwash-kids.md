One of my goals in life is to publish a book with a title along the lines of “Brainwash Your Kids” or “Propagandize Your Kids” after my kids leave the house, hopefully as competent, functional adults. I’ve heard countless stories of moderate or conservative parents watching their kids grow up to be some variety of liberal, to both parties’ frustration. If you’ve ever watched a conservative pundit talk about college, you’ll no doubt have heard similar anecdotes. The thing is, I think this phenomenon is mostly avoidable, especially if you believe in your own ideology. The key is to get them when they’re young.

I’ll start with an illustration showing the urgency of this matter. Studies have shown a huge gap between the fertility rate of conservatives and liberals. The more extreme statistic I’ve seen claims that liberals have 1.5 kids on average compared to the conservatives’ 2.5. Surely, this signals a new conservative renaissance? Maybe, but it’s not guaranteed. Not all children follow in the footsteps of their parents (one way to see this is to note how many liberals complain about their Fox News-watching father). To make the numbers easy, let’s say that conservatives have a 60% retention rate - 1.5:1 - and liberals 67% - 1:0.5. For 2 conservatives and 2 liberals, the 2.5 conservative children and 1.5 liberal children end up being 2 conservative adults and 2 liberal adults. A relatively small difference in retention rate destroys a 1 child difference, or 67% advantage, in fertility! The studies I’ve seen put the actual retention rate close to these figures, so the scenario is entirely plausible.

I’ve thought a lot about what shaped my ideology. Although I’m not an extremist on the idea that we are shaped by our surroundings and other factors outside our control - a view that I believe removes our free will - it is undeniably the largest factor. Opinions come in “levels” depending on how central they are to a person’s world view. If an American falsely thought that Toronto was the capital of Canada, she would not hesitate to change that belief when I correct her. On the other extreme, we may consider religion, which people rarely reconsider based on objective evidence alone. Someone’s overarching political view is almost at that level.

You must use this to your advantage. As a parent, you have the unique ability to seed ideas into your child’s brain - to give her the anchor that she will evaluate all new ideas against. My father did this when we watched Milton Friedman’s Free To Choose documentary when I was a child. I was amazed by the simplicity of the logic of free market economics, which later helped inform all my other views. Knowing more now, I understand there are strong arguments on “both sides,” but I will always look at opposing ideas with a more scrutinizing eye than ideas that fit into my pre-existing world view - a bias everyone has. Any sufficiently popular idea (libertarianism, socialism, Christianity, atheism, etc.) is almost undefeatable if your standard is to be charitable to your side and uncharitable to the other.

I don’t think it’s good to be too political with young children. Instead, the focus should be on cultural values. The most important one is religion. Although I don’t have too much advice on this, the concepts in the rest of the article will generally apply (also, you can read them the Bible, and then C. S. Lewis). The second, for conservatives, is to instill pro-family values into your child. Given the attitude of many on the left towards marriage, the family, and having kids, I think wanting to get married and have kids is the most innocuous thing that can be a catalyst to becoming an unwavering conservative. Although a conservative meme that may be a bit exaggerated, there is an undeniable relationship between being at odds with your parents (especially your father) and being liberal. Thus, you can start by raising your child well and fostering a mutually loving relationship (a task far more easily said than done). Another thing you could do is have a big family: if your family is happy, your children will naturally desire the same for themselves. A third easy thing to do is to expose your children to media that is pro-family (I unironically think Doraemon is a good example), or simply reinforcing these ideas into children through conversation (talking about how getting married and having kids is natural and good).

When they are older, you can introduce them to more complex political or economic ideas. The ideal is to homeschool, giving you full freedom to teach everything properly as well as a social circle that will likely be more religious, conservative, and libertarian. Otherwise, you must be vigilant and make sense to straighten out your kid whenever her teacher says something stupid. My dad was able to do this in one fell swoop when he told me to never trust my teachers. Indeed, teachers can no longer be viewed as much of a legitimate authority in our crumbling society and even more crumbling education system. They are the chaff instead of the wheat, on top of having an incentive to be loyal to their employer, the State, and contrary to its enemies, truth, the family, and God.

Conservatives need to figure out how to appeal to people’s basest, right-wing desires. The left knows what theirs are: jealousy (equality), greed (handouts), a desire to be accepted (body positivity, LGBT), a permissive attitude towards sin (drug legalization, legalized sex work), and the shirking of responsibilities (abortion, student debt forgiveness). Conservatives have their own slate: greed (capitalism), disgust (anti-LGBT), biological drive (pro-marriage, pro-family), and in-group preferences (immigration restriction). In a sense, conservatives must “dog-whistle” to their supporters on these issues, since the current liberal hegemony demonizes any care for these things that were taken for granted for millennia. I’ve already touched on marriage and family for children, but the other ones can be pushed, too. Raising a competent and competitive child is good for making them attracted to capitalism; not touching them is good for making them not gay. The true right-wing value is just to prefer the natural to the unnatural and in some sense the status quo to revolution. If you raise a child who is comfortable in her own body and with her place in the world, she will have been inoculated against most of the liberal utopian ideas that float around these days.

Conservative should understand that truth and the natural order is on their side. While conservative media is often mocked for being too on-the-nose, I think this view of conservatism offers a better way. The mark of a good story is one where some aspect of human nature is explored through the story, and any true conclusion that is reached will always be conservative.

It is so easy to do this, except for one thing - it requires the parent to have a good grasp of why they believe what they do. Do they know the best material to expose their kids to? Can they answer their kids’ questions? No doubt countless atheists have been minted by lackluster responses from their religious parents - or no responses at all. The good thing is you should really know “apologetics” for your beliefs anyways, especially for your religion. A bonus tip for the incompetent: the earlier you begin brainwashing your child, the more ingrained in their identity the ideas will be, making it easier for you to maintain that state of mind without too much ironclad argumentation. You can also offload the work to others by raising them in a specific community, like a Catholic school or a more conservative state/city - most people go along to get along.

So what are you waiting for? Why do people not talk about their religion or world view with their kids? I met a kid whose parents were (allegedly) Christians who, I swear, could barely explain the story of Jesus. This is the state of things. I bet all these boomers complaining about their liberal kids never spent that time with their kids. To quote Stefan Molyneux, “you pay now or you pay later.” Now, it’s not entirely their fault - most new parents probably don’t have some super thought-out world view, but it is their problem. And it might be your problem, but luckily you’ve read this article now so you have no excuse. You literally just have to lecture your kids about things you believe. I’m literally asking you to debate a small child who has every inclination to accept what you say as true by default; it’s literally the easiest thing in the world.
