The purpose of this new blog series is to act as a way to guide the conversation during my biweekly study groups. It may be useful for future study groups as well. I will comment on certain passages I find interesting. I aim to fill in certain details that I think are of interest.

> First, there is a very large difference between government money redeemable in gold, and irredeemable government money, even if both are run by the government. Under a gold standard, money is gold, and government just assumes a responsibility of minting standard units of the metal or printing paper backed by the gold [...] With irredeemable government money, on the other hand, the government's debt and/or paper is used as money, and the government is able to increase its supply as it sees fit.

Some libertarians should take this principle to heart. While government control is qualitatively different due to the coercion involved, in practice, we must consider how much the government control deviates from what would occur under a genuine free market.

> [C]ontrary to what the name might imply, no fiat money has come into circulation solely through government fiat; they were all originally redeemable in gold or silver [...] Government may issue decrees mandating people use their paper for payments, but no government has imposed this salability on papers without these papers having first been redeemable in gold and silver.

This rebuts claims by certain people that the value of fiat money comes from legal tender laws or the fact that taxes must be paid in the currency. This cannot explain its original source of value. The government cannot declare a new monetary system without pegging it to an existing good that has value. This is not merely a free market opinion - it is literally logically impossible. What would this new currency's price be, if not in reference to existing goods? After its initial value is established, it can maintain off a certain amount of inertia, since prices come from people's expectations derived from prices in the recent past. Once people begin valuing the currency at a certain peg to gold, the peg can be removed without instantly sending the fiat currency's vaule to 0.

> Until this day, all government central banks maintain reserves to back up the value of their national currency. The majority of countries maintain some gold in their reserves, and those countries which do not have gold reserves maintain reserves in the form of other countries' fiat currencies, which are in turn backed by gold reserves.

I've always wondered how holding hard assets maintain a currency's value if the currency is not by some way redeemable in the underlying asset.

Equities get their value, on top of the cash discounted of expected dividends, from voting rights. Since there is some value in controlling the capital associated with the company, the individual shares must reflect this, or else someone could turn a profit by buying a controlling share of the company. However, this logic does not apply to governments, as you cannot buy up a government (at least not in an above-board way).

In the 90s and early 2000s, China pegged its currency to the US dollar at a ratio of 8.28 to 1. During this time, China held large amount of US dollar assets to back their currency. The purpose of this backing was that if the RMB ever fell in value against the USD, China could start selling off its dollar-denominated assets to push the ratio back up. Having such a large reserve also gave China credibility that they would actually be able to do this. Even when currencies are not officially pegged to the reserve assets, holding these assets still means that they have the option of increasing the value of their currency through buying it with hardest assets. Additionally, the country's bonds are more attractive if they have more savings in harder assets, which raises demand for the currency. These are my main theories for how the reserves work to back the currency.

> Today, historians still fail to offer a convincing strategic or geopolitical explanation for why a conflict between the Austro‐Hungarian Empire and Serbian separatists was to trigger a global war that claimed the lives of millions and drastically reshaped most of the world's borders.

This is just an interesting framing to consider.

> Had European nations remained on the gold standard [...] forcing government to resort to taxation instead of inflation [...] [i]t is likely that World War I would have been settled militarily within a few months of conflict, as one of the allied factions started running out of financing and faced difficulties in extracting wealth from a population that was not willing to part with its wealth to defend their regime's survival. But with the suspension of the gold standard, running out of financing was not enough to end the war; a sovereign had to run out of its people's accumulated wealth expropriated through inflation.

This perfectly encapsulates the evil of inflation as a hidden tax. Many large government programs could not exist if they were not in part funded by inflation rather than direct taxation - which would reveal their true cost. Governments can inflate to the point of hyperinflation, which happened many times in history, such as Germany in WWI and the Confederacy in the American Civil War. This is essentially extracting all of a society's wealth, something that could never be achieved through taxation.

> The war was to continue for four more years with barely any progress, until the United States was to intervene in 1917 and swing the war in favor of one party at the expense of the other by bringing in a large amount of resources with which their enemies could no longer keep up.

Another bad thing done by Woodrow Wilson, who, as a progressive, made it his mission to end the European monarchies.

> As Britain's gold reserves were leaving its shores to places where they were better valued, the chief of the Bank of England, Sir Montagu Norman, leaned heavily on his French, German, and American counterparts to increase the money supply in their countries, devaluing their paper currencies in the hope that it would stem the flow of gold away from England. While the French and German bankers were not cooperative, Benjamin Strong, chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, was, and he engaged in inflationary monetary policy throughout the 1920s.

Rothbard's *America's Great Depression* goes a lot deeper into this, although it is quite a hard read. Basically, imagine this chapter, except 300 pages long. It was actually my first Rothbard book!

> Hoover not only increased government spending on public work projects to fight the Depression, but he also leaned on the Federal Reserve to expand credit, and made the focus of his policy the insane quest to keep wages high in the face of declining wage rates.

Hoover was insanely progressive, despite being a member of the Republican party. In fact, it is not particularly helpful to think of the parties as similar to what they are now. Harding, Coolidge, and Wilson may have fit our modern conceptions, but before that there were figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Grover Cleveland.

Hoover's quest to prevent wages from falling is common in Keynesian economics. To recognize the fallacy, we must realize that money is not a productive asset - it is simply a communication network. Having more money or less money does not mean more or less real goods on a societal level. This is hard to understand, since at an individual level, money is equivalent to goods. Falling wages and a "slowing" economy is simply a consequence of higher saving rates in times of uncertainty. Prices cannot fall indefinitely, as at some point they will be bid away to their new best use. Price and wage controls simply prevent economic calculation from occuring, preventing resources from going to their most highly valued uses. It is worth noting that the famously high unemployment rates were caused by wage controls, shedding light on modern debates about the minimum wage.

> It is a little‐known fact, carefully airbrushed from the history books, that in the 1932 U.S. general election, Hoover ran on a highly interventionist platform while Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran on a platform of fiscal and monetary responsibility.

Another interesting tidbit to keep in mind. A similar fact: Wilson ran on not participating in WWI.

> [T]he interventionist policies of Hoover were amplified into what came to be known as the New Deal.

There is a famous quote by one of FDR's underlings where he admitted that all of the New Deal policies were taken from Hoover. (I can't find it right now. If you can, please contact me and I'll add it here.)

> President Roosevelt issued an executive order banning the private ownership of gold, forcing Americans to sell their gold to the U.S. Treasury at a rate of $20.67 per ounce [...] Roosevelt then revalued the dollar on the international market from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce, a 41% devaluation of the dollar in real terms (gold).

Another very interesting tidbit.

> Saving reduces spending and because spending is all that matters, government must do all it can to deter its citizens from saving.

This relates to the famous Broken Window Fallacy from Henry Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson*. If you take demand-side economics to its logical conclusion, it makes no sense. That is why reasoning from first principles naturally leads to Austrian Economics.

> Instead [economics] became an arm of the government, meant to direct policymakers toward the best policies for managing economic activities.

You can read more about this in Murray Rothbard's *Anatomy of the State*. Academia is paid by the ruling class to be propagandists. This does not have to be a top-down conspiracy, either: economic incentives alone can explain this emergent phenomenon.

> With government war expenditure and conscription on the rise, aggregate expenditure soared while unemployment plummeted, so all countries involved in World War II had recovered because of their participation in the war.

This is one of the reasons why GDP is not a good measure of wealth. The availability of consumer goods has been offered as an alternative.

> GATT was meant to help the IMF in the impossible task of balancing budgets and trade to ensure financial stability—in other words, centrally planning global trade and fiscal and monetary policy to remain in balance, as if such a thing were possible.

The 20th century, up until the fall of the Soviet Union, was truly the height of socialism in the East and the West.

> The doctrine of violent militant Keynesianism claimed this spending would be good for the economy, which made the millions of lives it destroyed easier to stomach for the American electorate.

[Insert anti-war rant]

> In the presence of fiat money to finance government, political differences between parties disappear as politics no longer contains trade‐offs and every candidate can champion every cause.

This is why fiscal conservativism always falls on deaf ears. Trade-offs and oppportunit costs are never felt when everything is funded by debt and infation - the consequences are too distant, especially compared to the tenure of the politicans that cause them.

> Gold reserves were running low, and on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the end of dollar convertibility to gold, thus letting the gold price float in the market freely. In effect, the United States had defaulted on its commitment to redeem its dollars in gold.

It's amazing how the US pulled off history's biggest heist - stealing all of the world's gold in one fell swoop.

> [S]uch an idea is considered normal and unquestionable in most academic circles.

This shows how vapid most of academia is. Most "professors" are not motivated by the pursuit of truth, but rather to play by the rules of their discipline and pump up their publication numbers. They are status-seekers, not intellectuals. Ammous once said that "The Economist is Vogue for ugly people."

> History has shown that governments will inevitably succumb to the temptation of inflating the money supply [...] This is no different from copper producers mining more copper in response to monetary demand for copper.

The only reason the cost of printing more fiat money is not literally 0 is that the government must preserve legitimacy and control. However, this only limits the speed of inflation, not the ultimately destination of hyperinflation, which is always inevitable as the value of goods tends toward its cost of production.

> Should a currency credibly demonstrate its supply cannot be expanded, it would immediately gain value significantly. In 2003, when the United States invaded Iraq, aerial bombardment destroyed the Iraqi central bank and with it the capability of the Iraqi government to print new Iraqi dinars. This led to the dinar drastically appreciating overnight as Iraqis became more confident in the currency given that no central bank could print it anymore. A similar story happened to Somali shillings after their central bank was destroyed.

I forgot about these stories, but if true they are hilarious.

> Central banks' large reserves of gold can be used as an emergency supply to sell or lease on the gold market to prevent the price of gold from rising during periods of increased demand, to protect the monopoly role of government money. As Alan Greenspan once explained: “Central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise.”

This bolsters my theory from before.
