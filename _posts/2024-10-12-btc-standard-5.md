> In other words, time preference is positive for all humans; there is always a discount on the future compared to the present.

There is a small amount of range about time-preference in Austrian economics. One example people use is that someone in December may prefer to defer obtaining an ice cream until July. There proposed resolutions, although I would say that the most extreme version of time preference should only be treated as something that is true enough of the time to be useful in analyzing the economy and human action, rather than something that must be true no matter what. Bob Murphy has written about this (I believe as his doctoral thesis). It's also worth noting that natural, negative interest rates are possible and may occur under a Bitcoin standard, as Ammous points out himself in his podcast.

> A person who thinks of the long run is less likely to cheat, lie, or steal, because the reward for such activities may be positive in the short run, but can be devastatingly negative in the long run.

This is also why societies tend to get less violent as they become more developed. It makes less and less economic sense to aggress upon others when you have more and more to lose.

> But the effect of this manipulation of the price of capital is to artificially reduce the interest rate that accrues to savers and investors, as well as the one paid by borrowers. The natural implication of this process is to reduce savings and increase borrowing. At the margin, individuals will consume more of their income and borrow more against the future.

There are still proxies for the natural interest rate through different financal instruments, but of course it is must riskier than if this natural appreciation occurred through market-driven interest rates or natural deflation.

> Keynes complained about goldmining being a wasteful activity that consumed a lot of resources while adding nothing to real wealth. While his critique does contain a kernel of truth, in the sense that increasing the supply of the monetary medium does not increase the wealth of the society using it, he misses the point that gold's monetary role is a result of it being the metal likely to attract the least human and capital resources toward its mining and prospecting, compared to all others.

Another reason Bitcoin is better than gold. When gold becomes fully demonetized, it will help free up gold to be used as an industrial metal, such as in computer chips. Bitcoin, which has no alternative use, does not have the problem where its monetization distorts other aspects of the economy. It uses energy to mine, but its energy consumption is miniscule and, due to the properties of Bitcoin mining, does not usually compete with energy sources used by consumers or in production, instead opting for cheap energy that no one else can effectively use. This has a secondary effect of incentivizing and subsidizing novel methods of energy production, which I believe will be invaluable for technological progress.

> One of the fundamental laws of economics is the law of diminishing marginal utility, which means that acquiring more of any good reduces the marginal utility of each extra unit.

Blog about an interesting aspect of this fact coming soon...

> But money's marginal utility declines far slower than any other good, because it declines along with the utility of wanting any good, not one particular good.

I just really like this point.

> It is an ironic sign of the depth of modern‐day economic ignorance fomented by Keynesian economics that capitalism---an economic system based on *capital accumulation* from saving---is blamed for unleashing conspicuous consumption—the exact opposite of capital accumulation.

Good quote.

> If saving creates the possibility of capital accumulation and civilizational advance, debt is what can reverse it, through the reduction in capital stocks across generations, reduced productivity, and a decline in living standards.

I heard an analogy before that I liked. It basically said that our society is like a group of kids whose parents died and inherented a huge mansion. At the moment, we seem wealthy---we can play all day in a nice house without a care in the world---but the house, capital, is degrading over time. And because we do not save, which in this case is represented by spending some resources on maintaining the house instead of on consumption goods, there will come some point when we realize how poor we really are: the bust. The short-term boost, usually due to consuming capital previously accumulated, that is prevalent in disasterous, but popular, economic policies often makes it hard for people to realize what they are doing. When the ineveitable bust occurs, time works to prevent people from clearly seeing the causation.

> This sort of arrangement can last for a while, but its lasting cannot be mistaken for sustainability, as it is no more than the systematic consumption of the capital stock of society---the eating of the seed crop.

All this is quite ironic for governments who pretend to care so much about sustainability.

> The well‐known phenomenon of the modern breakdown of the family cannot be understood without recognizing the role of unsound money allowing the state to appropriate many of the essential roles that the family has played for millennia, and reducing the incentive of all members of a family to invest in long‐term familial relations.

Some people may object to this, as obviously no one is consciously not having kids or not working on their marriage because of monetary policy or FED interest rates. However, I think there is some kind of an ``evolutionary" effect in place, so that people who are high time preference are not punished and thus have more sway in society. In the past, these people would learn the hard way and act as an example of what not to do to others. Now, they get away scot-free and possibly talking about how the fuddy-duddies who warn about high time preference lifestyles are merely crying wolf.

> One cannot help but notice that there aren't too many Sistine Chapels being constructed today anywhere

This relates to another point: the relationship between religion and low time preerence. Nothing can lower time preference more than believing you will exist for the rest of eternity, and that your actions now may only ``pay off" at the further possible time naturally conceivable: death.

> But there is perhaps no more fitting tribute to the value of modern art than the many janitors at art exhibits worldwide who, demonstrating admirable perceptiveness and dedication to their job, have repeatedly thrown expensive modern art installations into the dustbins to which they belong.
