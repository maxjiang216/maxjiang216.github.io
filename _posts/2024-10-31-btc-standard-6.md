> As discussed earlier, capital production involves progressively sophisticated methods of production, longer time horizons, and a larger number of intermediate goods not consumed for their own sake, but only produced so as to take part in the production of final consumer goods in the future. Sophisticated structures of production only emerge from an intricate web of individual calculations by producers of each capital and consumer good buying and selling inputs and outputs to one another. The most productive allocation is determined only through the price mechanism allowing the most productive users of capital goods to bid highest for them.

This is why resource allocation games, especially highly complex ones like Factorio, are interesting and difficult, with massive inefficiencies inevitable. Some people can master these games, but that is only possible because of the full knowledge of the availability and use of the goods in the game, as well as a very well-defined goal. Gluts and shortages abound in these games, but in a capitalist system, surpluses would be sold off to where it is most needed.

> In the capital markets, something similar happens, but the effects are far more devastating as they affect every sector of the economy, because capital is involved in the production of every economic good.

This is a massive windfall as a capitalism-apologist. Almost every problem in the economy can be at leasts somewhat contributed to socialism in capital markets. As long as the money is controlled by the government, it is extremely difficult to estimate just how much inefficiency and damage it causes. For me, this realization helped me resolve so many challenges I had responding to apparent evidence against capitalism.

> While most people imagine that socialist societies are a thing of the past and that market systems rule capitalist economies, the reality is that a capitalist system cannot function without a free market in capital, where the price of capital emerges through the interaction of supply and demand and the decisions of capitalists are driven by accurate price signals.

Mises famously said that the best litmus test for determining if a society is fundamentally capitalist or socialist is whether it has a stock market, meaning a free market is capital allocation.

> If the central bank were to continue its inflationary process indefinitely, it would just increase the scale of misallocations in the economy, wasting even more capital and making the inevitable recession even more painful.

At the limit, it leads to hyperinflation, at which point the money is destroyed and society is reduced to a primitive state of barter.

> The president at the time, Warren Harding, had a strong commitment to free markets and refused to heed the call of interventionist economists.

Warren Harding may be the best President in American history.

> The normal workings of a free market will witness many people lose or quit their jobs, and many businesses will go bankrupt or shut down for a wide variety of reasons, but these job losses will roughly cancel out with newly created jobs and businesses, leading to a negligibly small number of people being involuntarily unemployed at any point in time, as was the case during the years in which the gold standard was not abused in the nineteenth century, and as was the case with Switzerland pre‐1992.

In a free market, idle workers will quickly be bid away. If you lose your job, of course you may experience a decline in income, but you cannot become involuntarily unemployed as your skills have positive value, even if it is just waiting tables. The minimum wage is another major factor in unemployment, both in first- and second-order effects.

> Tariffs and trade barriers hardly existed, and if they did, they constituted little more than fees to pay for the management and maintenance of border crossing points and seaports.

I actually don't know about this. I know the US mostly funded itself from tariffs before the income tax. Of course, taxes and government spending were miniscule then compared to now. In a related note, I generally support higher tariffs instead of taxing the domestic population. It seems to give all the right incentives to have economic activity in one's country and forcing foreigners to pay (part of) the costs of government. A wealthy country will have a strong consumer, which foreigners will want to sell to. Global competition and a thriving domestic market means foreigners will end up burdening the bulk of the cost of the tax (basically, it is easier for the citizens to do without foreign goods than vice versa).
