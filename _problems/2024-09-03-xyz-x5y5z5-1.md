# Problem

Solve

\\[x+y+z=x^5+y^5+z^5=1\\]

for $$x,y,z\in\mathbb{C}$$.

<!-- SOLUTION_START -->

# Solution

To solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + y + z = 1 \\
x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 1
\end{cases}
\]
with \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{C} \), we can explore the symmetric properties of the equations and use identities involving power sums and elementary symmetric sums.

**Step 1: Use Newton's Identities**

Define the power sums \( p_k = x^k + y^k + z^k \) and the elementary symmetric sums:
\[
\begin{cases}
s_1 = x + y + z = 1 \\
s_2 = xy + yz + zx \\
s_3 = xyz
\end{cases}
\]

Newton's identities relate power sums and elementary symmetric sums:
\[
\begin{cases}
p_1 = s_1 \\
p_2 = s_1 p_1 - 2 s_2 \\
p_3 = s_1 p_2 - s_2 p_1 + 3 s_3 \\
p_4 = s_1 p_3 - s_2 p_2 + s_3 p_1 \\
p_5 = s_1 p_4 - s_2 p_3 + s_3 p_2
\end{cases}
\]

Given \( p_1 = 1 \) and \( p_5 = 1 \), we can express \( p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5 \) in terms of \( s_2 \) and \( s_3 \):
\[
\begin{align*}
p_2 &= 1 - 2s_2 \\
p_3 &= -2 + 3s_3 \\
p_4 &= -1 + 4s_3 \\
p_5 &= 1 - 5s_2 + 5s_2^2 + 5s_3 - 5s_2s_3 = 1
\end{align*}
\]

Simplifying the equation \( p_5 = 1 \), we get:
\[
-s_2 + s_2^2 + s_3 - s_2 s_3 = 0
\]

This factors into:
\[
(1 - s_2)(-s_2 + s_3) = 0
\]

So either \( s_2 = 1 \) or \( s_3 = s_2 \).

**Case 1: \( s_2 = 1 \)**

In this case, \( p_2 = -1 \), \( p_3 = -2 + 3s_3 \), and \( p_5 = 1 \) regardless of \( s_3 \). The cubic equation becomes:
\[
t^3 - t^2 + t - s_3 = 0
\]
Since \( s_3 \) is arbitrary, this implies infinitely many solutions where \( x + y + z = 1 \), \( xy + yz + zx = 1 \), and \( x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 1 \).

**Case 2: \( s_3 = s_2 \)**

Here, the cubic equation is:
\[
t^3 - t^2 + s_2 t - s_2 = (t - 1)(t^2 + s_2) = 0
\]
This factors into \( t - 1 = 0 \) and \( t^2 + s_2 = 0 \). Therefore, one root is \( t = 1 \) and the other roots satisfy \( t^2 = -s_2 \). The solutions are:
\[
x = 1, \quad y = t, \quad z = -t, \quad \text{with } t \in \mathbb{C}
\]
This satisfies \( x + y + z = 1 \) and \( x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 1 \) since:
\[
x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 1 + t^5 + (-t)^5 = 1 + t^5 - t^5 = 1
\]

**Conclusion:**

The solutions to the system are all triples \( (x, y, z) \) where:
1. \( x = 1 \), \( y = t \), \( z = -t \), for any \( t \in \mathbb{C} \).
2. Any \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{C} \) satisfying \( x + y + z = 1 \), \( xy + yz + zx = 1 \), and \( x^5 + y^5 + z^5 = 1 \).

However, from the analysis, the solutions of the form \( x = 1 \), \( y = t \), \( z = -t \) are the complete set of solutions that satisfy both equations.

**Answer:**
An explicit description: All complex numbers with x = 1 and z = –y; that is,

  All (x, y, z) where x = 1 and y + z = 0.
