# Problem

Solve the equations in $$\mathbb{N}$$:
1. $$x^3-y^3=xy+61$$ (Soviet Union 1981)
2. $$x^3-y^3=xy+1995$$ (India 1995)

<!-- SOLUTION_START -->
# Solution

Without loss of generality, let $$x=y+d,d>0$$. Then, we have

\\[d^3+3yd^2+3y^2d-yd-y^2=k\\]

where $$k=61$$ or $$k=1995$$. Thus, $$d^3<k$$. We can use modular arithmetic to narrow the search.
