As Bitcoin nears its fourth halving, marking the end of its current "cycle," it is worth revisiting the classics: Saifedean Ammous's groundbreaking [The Bitcoin Standard](https://saifedean.com/tbs){:target="_blank"} and the impeccable sequel [The Fiat Standard](https://saifedean.com/tfs){:target="_blank"}. Alongside hundreds of pages of innovative analysis and argumentation, Ammous included several statistics about Bitcoin's historical performance in various metrics to bolster his thesis. The Bitcoin Standard and The Fiat Standard were published in 2018 and 2021, respectively, both shortly after the post-halving bull markets. Since then, we have been experiencing the longest bear market in Bitcoin's history. Here I will consider a few statistics used in his books: stock-to-flow, price volatility, and price appreciation, extend them to the present, and analyze whether his arguments still hold up.

# Stock to Flow

The most important statistic in Bitcoin is its stock-to-flow ratio. Stock-to-flow measures the total existing stock of a commodity against its annual production (it is the reciprocal of the annual supply growth rate). It is perhaps the most important property to consider when assessing the suitability of a commodity to be a money, with higher ratios making for a "harder" money that is better at preserving its value, as Ammous argues in his two books. Historically, gold and silver had the highest stock-to-flow ratio, leading to their adoption as global currencies. While gold's stock-to-flow is currently slightly higher than Bitcoin's, Bitcoin will surpass gold in this respect after the upcoming 2024 halving. The hardest money humanity has ever known will continue to increase its stock-to-flow until approximately 2140. At this point, no new Bitcoins will be created ever again and Bitcoin will become the only commodity with an infinite stock-to-flow ratio.

The actual stock-to-flow numbers are estimated from the [hash rate](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate){:target="_blank"} and [network difficulty](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty){:target="_blank"} for the Bitcoin network from [Blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Due to Bitcoin's algorithmic supply schedule, it is easy to accurately predict its stock-to-flow ahead of time. In The Bitcoin Standard, Ammous estimates the following stock-to-flow ratios:

| Year | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| Predicted S2F  | 26.17 | 27.17 | 38.31 | 56.50 | 57.47 |
| Actual S2F | 24.96 | 26.48 | 40.58 | 57.55 | 57.07 |
| Error % | 4.85 | 2.61 | 5.59 | 1.82 | 0.70 |

 The predicted numbers based on a 10-minute block assumption is accurate with errors of only a few percent. The year with the largest error is in 2020, where a large decrease in production occurred when China banned Bitcoin mining in the summer, causing a drastic 40% drop in the hash rate while Chinese miners relocated to neighboring countries. Despite this and other shocks to the Bitcoin network, we see that Bitcoin's supply schedule continues to be extremely predictable. Predictability is invaluable in a market economy and this is yet another way Bitcoin sets itself apart from fiat currencies and physical commodities like gold.

# Price Volatility

Price volatility is one of the greatest hurdles preventing widespread Bitcoin adoption. Extreme volatility is perhaps expected from such a unique asset. In fact, if Bitcoin truly captures all the value from asssets like gold, real estate, and bonds, it is almost necessary that the journey it takes be wild and bumpy. Suppose otherwise, so that Bitcoin's price was consistently increasing at its historical rate of more than 50%. If this trend continued, it would attract enormous capital due to the seemingly risk-free return. Such an inflow would significantly boost Bitcoin's price until the inevitable correction. If there is not a correction, Bitcoin's price would increase faster and faster until it consumed all the value in the world (an event known as hyperbitcoinization). Thus, until hyperbitcoinization, we can continue to expect Bitcoin's legendary bull markets and large drawdowns. Bitcoin's complete supply inelasticity also contributes to price volatility. As Ammous notes in The Bitcoin Standard:

"Bitcoin's volatility derives from the fact that its **supply is utterly inflexible and not responsive to demand changes** [...] For any regular commodity, the variation in demand will affect the production decisions of producers of the commodity: **an increase in demand causes them to increase their production, moderating the rise in the price** [...] **a decrease in demand would cause producers to decrease their supply**."

That being said, as Bitcoin's price increases and thus the liquidity of the Bitcoin market increases, the price volatility will naturally go down. In 2021, Bloomberg published the article [Have $93 Million? You May Be Able to Boost Bitcoin’s Price by 1%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/have-93-million-you-may-be-able-to-boost-bitcoin-s-price-by-1) about Bitcoin's relatively sensitive price. $93 million is relatively small. large organizations such as MicroStrategy and the El Salvadorean government often buy much more than that in a single day. As Bitcoin's market cap increases, it will take more and more capital to appreciably change Bitcoin's price. From the Bitcoin Standard:

"[A]s the size of the market grows, along with the sophistication and the depth of the financial institutions dealing with Bitcoin, this volatility will likely decline. With a larger and more liquid market, the daily variations in demand are likely to become relatively smaller."

We have potentially seen this in action throughout the current cycle, with the peak of the bull market being relatively small compared to previous cycles and the unprecedented price stability of 2023.

In 2018, Ammous wrote in The Bitcoin Standard:

"While the price of bitcoin has generally risen over time, this rise has been highly volatile [...] While the volatility appears to be declining, it remains very high compared to that of national currencies and gold, and the trend is still too weak to conclusively determine if it will continue to decline."

With five more years of data, we can say with greater confidence that the trend is real, although it is still weak.

It will be very interesting to see Bitcoin's price volatility after 2024 halving. In particular, increased adoption due to the increasingly likely Bitcoin spot price ETF from the likes of Blackrock and Fidelity as well as adoption on corporation balance sheets due both to a trusted ETF and new FASB rules could significantly increase the size of the market and thus price stability.

# Price Appreciation

The historical performance of Bitcoin is usually the strongest initial draw to study and invest in Bitcoin. [While people who don't understand the first thing about Bitcoin like to crawl out of the woodwork every bear market and talk about how poorly Bitcoin is performing](https://youtu.be/WzDZslpSZ_8?t=4002), they conveniently ignore that even the 50-90% drawdowns in price leave Bitcoin well above the previous bull market highs. It is much better to measure Bitcoin's price appreciation on a time horizon of at least 4 years. This is the approximately the length of a halving cycle. Each cycle comes with a bull market after which point Bitcoin's price never returns to levels in the previous cycle. This analysis reveals that Bitcoin has *never* been less than 2 times its price at the analogous point in the previous cycle. This following chart was created by comparing Bitcoin's price to the price 1384 days prior (about 3.79 years). This is the average length of a halving cycle, excluding the first cycle which was abnormally short and using the projected halving for the current cycle.

Saifedean comments about the price appreciation up to 2021 in The Fiat Standard:

"In its twelve years of existence, Bitcoin has never been down over a four-year period. Except for one day, it has always been valued at **more than fivefold its price four years earlier**. Bitcoin’s four-year performance averages a 365-fold increase. Examining only the past five years of data, bitcoin has averaged a 26.05-fold increase over its price four years earlier."

As we have seen, two years later, Bitcoin has still never been down over a four-year period. Unfortunately, we have seen much worse performance in Bitcoin's price in the current bear market, with the price being under 5 times its price in the previous cycle for most of 2022 and all of 2023. There are many theories for why Bitcoin is not performing as well. The most prominent is the idea of "diminishing returns." Since Bitcoin's stock-to-flow is not increasing as quickly, we might expect this to reflect in the price. Additionally, it becomes harder and harder to get the amount of new capital needed to push the price up higher and higher as the market size of Bitcoin grows. Others reject the idea that subsequent cycles will necessarily see diminishing growth, pointing to the many special circumstances of this halving, including:
- The global COVID-19 lockdowns throughout 2020 and 2021 overlapping heavily with this cycle's bull market
- A recession or depression in many parts of the world due both to the COVID-19 lockdowns and the boom-bust cycle
- China's 2021 Bitcoin mining ban disrupting the 2021 bull market due to Chinese miners liquidating their Bitcoin to relocate to neighboring countries

More recently, we have discovered that Sam Bankman-Fried had been manipulating Bitcoin's price through FTX, most notably by selling customers more Bitcoin than FTX owned. Essentially, FTX was engaging in fractional-reserve banking with respect to Bitcoin, which could have significantly increased Bitcoin's supply and stock-to-flow. In effect, Bitcoin became like any other commodity: it experienced an increase in production following an increase in price. This significantly moderated the peak price during the bull run.

However, there are still reasons to believe that the next bull market could be bigger than the previous. These reasons include:
- A significant demand shock due to a Bitcoin ETF in the US
- Increased corporate adoption due to the more favorable FASB rules
- Significant money printing due to recessions and depressions in the West
- Increased awareness due to promotion by US presidential candidates and other world leaders

# Conclusion

We have seen that most of Saifedean Ammous's analysis still holds true years later. As Bitcoiners often say, Bitcoin will keep on doing what it does. While price appreciation this cycle have not been at the level of cycles past, there is still hope for a turnaround after the next halving. Truly, the next halving will give much-needed data and clarity about Bitcoin's future.
