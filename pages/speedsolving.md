# Speedsolving

Rubik's cube "speedsolving," where competitors solve Rubik's cubes and other twisty puzzles as quickly as possible, is one of my favorite hobbies. I learned how to solve a Rubik's Cube in 2015 because there was a competition in my area and I have been hooked ever since!

My personal best time for solving the Rubik's Cube is 4.36s. My other accomplishments include:
 - 2x2x2 Cube: 5th in Canada, top 100 globally with an average of 2.32s
 - 4x4x4 Cube: 24.13s personal best
 - 5x5x5 Cube: 49.58s personal best
 - Rubik's Cube One-Handed: 8.57s personal best
