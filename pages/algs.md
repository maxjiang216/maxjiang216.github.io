# Rubik's Cube Algorithms

I plan on putting the algorithms I use on my website. This is primarily for my own benefit, although after cubing for almost 10 years I think that the algorithms I have amassed over the years could be useful for others as well.

Algorithm sets:
- PLL
- OLL
- ZBLL
- ZBLS
- OLS
- F2L
- Multislotting

I am currently looking for good sources for ZBLS algorithms. If you know of any, please contact me by email at [maxjiang216@gmail.com](mailto:maxjiang216@gmail.com).
