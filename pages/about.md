# About

- I am a 4th year at the University of Waterloo pursuing a double major in Computer Science & Statistics.
- I enjoy learning and reading about a wide variety of topics, including history, economics, and religion.
- I enjoy [speedsolving the Rubik's cube](speedsolving).
- My favorite number is 216. This is because I once guessed this number for a [very difficult math Olympiad problem](https://hmmt-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/tournaments/2019/feb/comb/problems.pdf) which turned out, against all odds, to be correct.
