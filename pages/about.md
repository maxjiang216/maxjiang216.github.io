# About

- I am a 4th year at the University of Waterloo pursuing a double major in CS & Statistics.
- I am interested in many areas of math and computer science. Currently, I am most interested in machine learning.
- I enjoy [speedsolving the Rubik's cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing){:target="_blank"}.
- My favorite number is 216. This is because I once guessed this number for a [very difficult math Olympiad problem](https://hmmt-archive.s3.amazonaws.com/tournaments/2019/feb/comb/problems.pdf) which turned out, against all odds, to be correct.
