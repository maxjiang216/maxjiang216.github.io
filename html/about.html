        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I am a 3rd year CS & statistics student at the University of Waterloo.
            <br>
            I am interested in many areas of math and computer science. Currently, I am most interested in machine learning.
            <br>
            Outside of math and computer science, I enjoy reading books about history, philosophy, and economics.
            <br>
            I am currently studying Japanese. I'm also doing my best to maintain my native Chinese.
            <br>
            My main hobby is "speedsolving" the Rubik's Cube.
