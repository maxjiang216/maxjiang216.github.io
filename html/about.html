        <p>
            I am a 3rd year CS & statistics student at the University of Waterloo.
            I am interesed in many areas of math and computer science, but currently I am focusing on machine learning.
            Outside of math and computer science, I enjoy reading books about history, philosophy, and economics.
            I am currently studying Japanese and doing my best to maintain my native Chinese.
            My main hobby is "speedsolving" the Rubik's Cube. My best time is 4.65 seconds.
