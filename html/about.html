        <h1>Max Jiang</h1>
        Hi. I'm a first-year computer science student at the University of Waterloo. My interests include, in no particular order, math (incl. CS), politics, anime, linguistics, and Rubik's Cube speedsolving.

        <h2>Math & CS</h2>
        I did UWaterloo's Gauss math contest for the first time in 3rd grade and have been studying math ever since. I took a course in Python in 5th grade and started participating in UWaterloo's CCC computer science contest in 10th grade. Here are some of my contest accomplishments:
        <ul>
            <li>2-time Canadian Math Olympiad Qualifier (2019, 2020)</li>
            <li>USA Math Olympiad Qualifier (2019)</li>
            <li>Asia-Pacific Math Olympiad Qualifier (2020)</li>
            <li>Canadian Computing Olympiad Bronze Medalist (2019)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Linguistics</h2>
        I started participating in linguistics contests in 10th grade. I qualified for Team Canada Moose at the International Linguistics Olympiad in 2019 and 2020 (although the event was ultimately cancelled in 2020). Here are some of my contest accomplishments:
        <ul>
            <li>International Linguistics Olympiad Silver Medalist (2019)</li>
            <li>Online Linguistics Olympiad Silver Medalist (2020)</li>
            <li>Asia-Pacific Linguistics Olympiad (unofficial) Silver Medalist (2020)</li>
        </ul>
        I also enjoy learning languages. Currently, I am working on improving my native Chinese and become fluent in Japanese. I've also dabbled in French and Spanish from primary and secondary school.
        <h2>Politics</h2>
        I enjoy watching news about US politics. Avid armchair political scientist, philosopher, and economist. On the mathy side of things, I analyze electoral and demographic data, in part to make election predictions. My proudest accomplishment on this front is correctly predicting every US Senate election in the 2020 cycle.
        <h2>Rubik's Cube Speedsolving</h2>
        I learned how to solve the Rubik's Cube in 7th grade for a local competition. Since then, I have spent a lot of time learning how to solve new puzzles and getting faster. At my peak, I was 13th overall at speedsolving in Canada. Some accomplishments are:
        <ul>
            <li>Former top 100 globally for 2x2x2 Cube Average of 5</li>
            <li>Former top 10 in Canada for 3x3x3 Cube Blindfolded Single</li>
            <li>Solving 9 cubes blindfolded in 43 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        My personal best times are:
        <ul>
            <li>Rubik's Cube: 4.65</li>
            <li>Rubik's Cube One-Handed: 9.00</li>
            <li>Rubik's Cube Blindfolded: 57.97</li>
            <li>4x4 Cube: 25.82</li>
            <li>4x4 Blindfolded: 10:03.17</li>
            <li>5x5 Cube: 1:04.57</li>
            <li>Megaminx: 55.84</li>
            <li>Square-1: 9.93</li>
            <li>6x6 Cube: 2:25.56</li>
            <li>7x7 Cube: 3:40.66</li>
            <li>Rubik's Cube with Feet: 1:27.76</li>
            <li>Rubik's Cube Multiple Blindfolded: 9/9 43:16.23</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Anime</h2>
        I enjoy watching anime and reading manga. Not to be lumped in with other (often maligned) anime-enthusiasts, I am learning Japanese through watchin anime and reading manga and Japanese light novels.
